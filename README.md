# netsession-windows
I have a friend. He uses Windows 7 (32 / 64bit) to share folders & files. He got a problem when there were 20 concurrent users who logged into the host. So I made a script to auto-refresh the Windows session.

ps: The effect of this script is, every path that has been registered in Windows Explorer will refresh the username and password. So you need to write a username and password again.
